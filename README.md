# Human Activity Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Machine Learning / Deep Learning techniques.  
The system analyzes input data (video/sensor/dataset-based) and classifies different human activities such as walking, running, sitting, etc.

The objective is to build an AI-based model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying physical human actions.
